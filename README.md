# Student Table

## Description

This project is a student table developed using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The table displays important information about the students, including their names, emails, enrollment status, grades 1 and 2, as well as the average. The design and logic of the project were created from scratch by myself, representing my first project using these technologies. Additionally, the application is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across a wide range of devices.
